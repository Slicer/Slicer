# Extensions

An extension is a delivery package that bundles one or more Slicer modules. Once installed, the associated modules appear in 3D Slicer just like built-in ones.

Users can access additional functionality by installing extensions through the [Extensions Manager](extensions_manager.md) interface. Alternatively, extension packages can be browsed and downloaded from [extensions.slicer.org](https://extensions.slicer.org).

Developers can contribute new capabilities to the platform by creating extensions. For more information, see the [Extension Development Guide](/developer_guide/extensions.md).
