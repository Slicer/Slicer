# Image Segmentation

## Basic concepts

Segmentation of images (also known as contouring or annotation) is a procedure to delinate regions in the image, typically corresponding to anatomical structures, lesions, and various other object space.
It is a very common procedure in medical image computing, as it is required for visualization of certain structures, quantification (measuring volume, surface, shape properties), 3D printing, and masking (restricting processing or analysis to a specific region), etc.

Segmentation may be performed manually, for example by iterating through all the slices of an image and drawing a contour at the boundary; but often semi-automatic or fully automatic methods are used. [Segment Editor](modules/segmenteditor.md) module offers a wide range of segmentation methods.

### Segmentation and segment

Result of a segmentation is stored in `segmentation` node in 3D Slicer. A segmentation node consists of multiple segments.

A `segment` specifies region for a single structure. Each segment has a number of properties, such as name, preferred display color, content description (capable of storing standard DICOM coded entries), and custom properties. Segments may overlap each other in space.

### Representations

A region can be represented in different ways, for example as a binary labelmap (value of each voxel specifies if that voxel is inside or outside the region) or a closed surface (surface mesh defines the boundary of the region). There is no one single representation that works well for everything: each representation has its own advantages and disadvantages and used accordingly.

Each segment stored in multiple `representations`. One representation is designated as the `source representation` (marked with a "gold star" on the user interface). The source representation is the only editable representation, it is the only one that is stored when saving to file, and all other representations are computed from it automatically.

### Binary labelmap representation

Binary labelmap representation is probably the most commonly used representation because this representation is the easiest to edit. Most software that use this representation, store all segments in a single 3D array, therefore each voxel can belong to a single segment: segments cannot overlap. In 3D Slicer, overlapping between segments is allowed. To store overlapping segments in binary labelmaps, segments are organized into `layers`. Each layer is stored internally as a separate 3D volume, and one volume may be shared between many non-overlapping segments to conserve memory.

In a segmentation with its source representation set to binary labelmap, each layer is allowed to have different geometry (origin, spacing, axis directions, extents) temporarily - to allow moving segments between segmentations without unnecessary quality loss (each resampling of a binary labelmap can lead to slight changes). All layers are forced to have the same geometry during certain editing operations and when the segmentation is saved to file.

## Segmentation modules

There are many modules in 3D Slicer for manipulating segmentations. Overview of the most important is provided below.

Segmentation modules in Slicer core:
- [Segmentations](modules/segmentations.md): Adjust display options, manage segment representations and layers, copy/move segments between segmentations, convert between segmentation and models and labelmap volumes, export to files.
- [Segment Editor](modules/segmenteditor.md): Create and edit segmentations from images using manual (paint, draw, ...), semi-automatic (thresholding, region growing, interpolation, ...) and automatic tools. A number of editor effects are built into the Segment Editor module and many more are provided by extensions (in "Segmentations" category in the Extensions Manager).
- [Segment statistics](modules/segmentstatistics.md): Computes intensity and geometric properties for each segment, such as volume, surface, minimum/maximum/mean intensity, oriented bounding box, sphericity, etc. See more information in.
