# Retired Modules

The modules listed below have been retired and are no longer present in 3D Slicer. This page exists as a convenient marker for historical details about retired modules.

Retiring modules reduces burden on Slicer developers.

A short list of reasons why a module may have been retired:

- The module has been superseded with another, and is not recommended
- The module has no development support, and no longer runs properly
