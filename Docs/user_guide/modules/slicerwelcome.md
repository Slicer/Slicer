# Welcome

## Overview

This module is intended as a welcome screen and basic overview of the Slicer software.

By default Slicer shows this module at startup, but this can be changed by selecting a different module in application settings -> Modules -> Default startup module.

## Panels and their use

### Updates

This section allows configuring application and extension update checks.

If `Check for updates - Automatically` checkbox is checked then it means that the application periodically queries the Slicer download and extension servers to determine if updates are available for the main application or for any installed extensions. If the checkbox is gray (neither checked nor unchecked) then it means that either application or extension update check is enabled but not both. The servers may collect anonymous statistics of these queries.

`Check now` button can be used to force an immediate check for application and extension updates. This may be useful if automatic update checks are disabled or extensions may have been updated since the last automatic update check.
