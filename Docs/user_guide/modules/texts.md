# Texts

## Overview

A module to create, edit and manage text data in the scene, such as short strings or text files (txt, xml, json).

## Panels and their use

- **Contents**: Text can be viewed and edited in this section.
- **Advanced**
  - **Auto-save edits to the text node**: If enabled then content in the scene is immediately updated on each keypress. If disabled then **Edit** button must be pressed to enable editing the text and clicking **Save** or **Cancel** button finishes editing.
  - **Enable word wrapping**: Switch between wrapping long lines / displaying a horizontal scrollbar.
