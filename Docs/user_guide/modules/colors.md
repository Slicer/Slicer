# Colors

## Overview

The Colors module manages color look up tables, stored in Color nodes. These tables translate between a numeric value and a color for displaying of various data types, such as volumes (to specify coloring based on voxel values), models (for displaying scalars), and markups (for displaying curve curvatures and other measurements in 3D views). The module also used for assigning colors to various displayable nodes and show color legend in viewers.

Two lookup table types are available:
- Discrete table: List of named colors are specified (example: GenericAnatomyColors). Discrete tables can be used for continuous mapping as well, in this case the colors are used as samples at equal distance within the specified range, and smoothly interpolating between them (example: Grey).

- Continuous scale: Color is specified for arbitrarily chosen numerical values and color value can be computed by smoothly interpolating between these values (example: PET-DICOM). No names are specified for colors.

## How to

### Edit a color lookup table

All built-in lookup tables are read-only to ensure consistency when using these colors. To edit a lookup table:
- Go to Colors module
- Choose a built-in lookup table that is similar to the desired color mapping. For example, `Labels` can be used as a starting points for a discrete table, `PET-DICOM` can be used for creating an editable continous scale.
- Click the yellow "copy" folder + icon next to the colors selector to create a copy.
- Specify a name for the new color lookup table and click OK.

The loaded color table will appear in the "User generated" category at the top. Click on the arrow on the category name (or click to select and hit the right-arrow key) to open it and see the color tables in that category.

### Save a color lookup table

To save a modified color table to file, use the application menu: File / Save.

File format is described in the [Developer guide](../../developer_guide/modules/colors).

### Load a color lookup table

To save a modified color table to file, drag-and-drop the file to the application window (or use the application menu: File / Add Data) and click OK.

The loaded color table will appear in the "File" category at the top. Click on the arrow on the category name (or click to select and hit the right-arrow key) to open it and see the color tables in that category.

### Show color legend

There are several ways of showing/hiding color legend:
- In Data module, right-clicking on an eye icon in the data tree opens the visibility menu. In that menu, "Show color legend" option can be used for showing/hiding the color legend in all views. The option only appears if a color lookup table is already associated with the selected item.
- Colors module allows adding/removing color legend to any displayable node at one place: open the Color Legend section, select a displayable node (volume, model, markup). Click `Create` to create a color legend, and adjust visualization options.
- Color Legend section in Volumes, Models, Markups modules can be used to show legend for the selected node.

For displaying mapping from numeric values to colors (for example, for displaying a parametric image), choose `Label text` -> `Value`. For displaying color names (for example, names of anatomical structures for a labelmap volume), choose `Label text` -> `Color name`.

:::{admonition} Tip

For displaying color legend for segment names: [Export the segments to a labelmap volume](segmentations.md#export-segmentation-to-labelmap-volume). This creates a color table, which can be displayed as a color legend.

## Panels and their use

- **Colors:** a drop down menu from which to select from the list of loaded color nodes
  - Copy Color Node button: Duplicate the current color node to edit the color entries. Necessary, because built-in color nodes are note editable.
- **Discrete table**
  - **Number of Colors:** the number of colors in the currently selected table.
  - **Hide empty Colors:** When checked, hide the unnamed color entries in the list below.
  - **Scalar Range:** The range of scalar values that are mapped to to the full range of colors. This only changes the display range, not the values in the table. It is used if the scalar range in a model or markups node is chosen as "Color table (LUT)"
  - **Table of currently selected colors**
    - **Index:** the integer value giving the index of this color in the look up table, used to match it up with a scalar value in a volume voxel.
    - **Color:** a box showing the current color. When viewing an editable table, double click on it to bring up a color picker.
    - **Label:** the text description of the color, often an anatomical label. For some tables, the name is automatically generated from the RGBA values.
    - **Opacity:** a value between 0 and 1 describing how opaque this color is. The background color at index 0 is usually set to 0 and other colors to 1.
- **Continuous Display Panel**: Inspect the color values by clicking on the circles that determine the points of the continuous function. Click elsewhere in the color display to add new points.
  - **Point:** the index of this point.
  - **Color box:** click on this to edit the color for this point.
  - **X:** the numeric value that maps to this color.
- **Color legend**
  - **Displayable node:** node that the color legened will ve displayed for.
  - **Color legend**
    - **Create**: create color legend for the selected Displayable node, using the Colors node chosen at the top.
    - **Use current colors**: set the Colors node chosen at the top for showing the Displayable node.
    - **Delete**: remove the Displayable node's color legend.
  - **Visible:** show/hide the color legend.
  - **View:** Choose which views the color legend is allowed to be appear in. Color legend for models and markups is only displayable in the views where these nodes appear.
  - **Title:** Title displayed at the top of the color legend. Set to the Displayable node's name by default.
  - **Label text**
    - **Value:** Numeric value is displayed in labels next to the color bar. Intended for displaying continuous numeric scale.
    - **Color name:** The color name is displayed in labels next to the color bar. Intended for displaying names of labels (segments).
  - **Number of labels:** Number of labels to display. Only applicable if `Value` is used as label text.
  - **Number of colors:** Maximum number of colors displayed. Reduce the number to see discrete colors instead of a continuous color gradient. Only applicable if `Value` is used as label text.
  - **Orientation**: choose between horizontal or vertical color bar orientation.
  - **Position**: horizontal and vertical position in the view
  - **Size**: length of the long and short side of the legend box.
  - **Title properties** and **Label properties**: controls the format of the title and label text.
  - **Format:** label format (only for label properties). Defined using [printf specifiers](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/printf/). Examples:
    - display with 1 fractional digit: `%.1f`
    - display integer values: `%.0f`
    - display with 4 significant digits: `%.4g`
    - display string label annotation: `%s`
  - **Color:** text color.
  - **Opacity:** allows displaying the text semi-transparently.
  - **Font:** the font used to display the title text. Arial: sans-serif font. Courier: fixed-width font. Times: serif font.
  - **Style:** check these boxes if you wish to adjust the style of the title text font. **Shadow** makes the text visible over both dark and bright background.
  - **Size:** font size ot the title. Label size is auto-scaled to fit the specified size of the color legend.
