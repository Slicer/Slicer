# About 3D Slicer

## What is 3D Slicer?

- A software application for visualization and analysis of medical image computing data sets. All commonly used data sets are supported, such as images, segmentations, surfaces, annotations, transformations, etc., in 2D, 3D, and 4D. Visualization is available on desktop and in virtual reality. Analysis includes segmentation, registration, and various quantifications.
- A research software platform, which allows researchers to quickly develop and evaluate new methods and distribute them to clinical users. All features are available and extensible in Python and C++. A full Python environment is provided where any Python packages can be installed and combined with built-in features. Slicer has a built-in Python console and can act as a Jupyter notebook kernel with remote 3D rendering capabilities.
- Product development platform, which allows companies to quickly prototype and release products to users. Developers can focus on developing new methods and do not need to spend time with redeveloping basic data import/export, visualization, interaction features. The application is designed to be highly customizable (with custom branding, simplified user interface, etc.). 3D Slicer is completely free and there are no restrictions on how it is used - it is up to the software distributor to ensure that the developed application is suitable for the intended use.

**Note:** There is no restriction on use, but Slicer is **NOT** approved for clinical use and the distributed application is intended for research use. Permissions and compliance with applicable rules are the responsibility of the user. For details on the license see [here](https://www.slicer.org/wiki/License).

Highlights:
- Free, [open-source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source>) software available on multiple operating systems: Linux, MacOSX and Windows.
- Multi organ: from head to toe.
- Support for multi-modality imaging including, MRI, CT, US, nuclear medicine, and microscopy.
- Real-time interface for medical devices, such as surgical navigation systems, imaging systems, robotic devices, and sensors.
- Highly extensible: users can easily add more capabilities by installing additional modules from the Extension manager, running custom Python scripts in the built-in Python console, run any executables from the application's user interface, or implement custom modules in Python or C++.
- Large and active user community.

## Acknowledgments

Slicer is made possible through contributions from an international community of scientists from a multitude of fields, including engineering and biomedicine. The following sections give credit to some of the major contributors to the 3D Slicer core effort. Each 3D Slicer extension has a separate acknowledgements page with information specific to that extension.

Ongoing Slicer support depends on YOU

Please give the Slicer repository a star on github. This is an easy way to show thanks and it can help us qualify for useful services that are only open to widely recognized open projects.
Don't forget to cite our publications because that helps us get new grant funding.
If you find Slicer is helpful like the community please get involved. You don't need to be a programmer to help!
