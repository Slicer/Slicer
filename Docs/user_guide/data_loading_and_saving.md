# Data Loading and Saving

There are two major types of data that can be loaded to Slicer: DICOM and non-DICOM.

## DICOM data

DICOM is a widely used and sophisticated set of standards for digital radiology.

Data can be loaded from DICOM files into the scene in two steps:

1. Import: add files into the application's DICOM database, by switching to DICOM module and drag-and-dropping files to the application window
2. Load: get data objects into the scene, by double-clicking on items in the DICOM browser. The DICOM browser is accessible from the toolbar using the DICOM button ![](../../Base/QTGUI/Resources/Icons/Medium/SlicerLoadDICOM.png).

Data in the scene can be saved to DICOM files in two steps:

1. Export to database: save data from the scene into the application's DICOM database
2. Export to file system: copy DICOM files from the database to a chosen folder in the file system

More details are provided in the [DICOM module documentation](modules/dicom.md).

## Non-DICOM data

Non-DICOM data, covering all types of data ranging from images (nrrd, nii.gz, ...) and models (stl, ply, obj, ...) to tables (csv, txt), point lists (json), etc.

### Load data

To load data:
- drag&drop file on the application window, or
- in application menu: `File` -> `Add Data` (or `Add Data` toolbar button) ![](../../Base/QTGUI/Resources/Icons/Medium/SlicerLoadData.png)

![](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/releases/download/docs-resources/data_loading_and_saving_load_dialog.png)

### Save data

To save the entire scene (all data, visualization and processing settings, etc.):
- in application menu `File` -> `Save Data`, or
- `Save Data` toolbar button ![](../../Base/QTGUI/Resources/Icons/Medium/SlicerSave.png)

:::{tip}

The entire workspace, including all data and settings can be saved into a single, independent, self-contained `.mrb` file by clicking on the small package icon at the top-left corner. A new copy of all files is written and zipped into a single file, therefore saving takes longer time than an incremental saving of only the modified files.

### Export data

To export selected data sets - for sharing with others or for loading into other applications: go to `Data` module, right-click on an item, and choose `Export to file...`. Settings used for exporting (file format, filename, options) do not modify settings used for saving.

![](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/releases/download/docs-resources/data_loading_and_saving_export_dialog.png)

:::{tip}

Multiple nodes can be exported at once by placing them into a folder and then by exporting the folder. When exporting an entire folder hierarchy the `Export folder structure` option can be enabled to have the directory structure in the output directory match the subject hierarchy folder structure.

## Supported Data Formats

:::{note}

### On use of LPS/RAS coordinate systems

DICOM and most medical imaging software uses the **LPS coordinate system** for storing all data. Axis directions of this coordinate system are patient left, posterior, and superior. Unit is millimeters. The choice of origin is arbitrary because only relative differences have meaning, so there is no universal standard, but it is often set to some geometric center of the imaging system, or it is chosen to be near the center of an object of interest.

**RAS coordinate system** is almost the same as the LPS coordinate system, except the axis directions are patient right, anterior, superior, i.e., the sign of the first two coordinates is inverted. Both LPS and RAS were in wide use in the early 2000s when development of Slicer was started and Slicer developers chose to use the RAS coordinate system.  Historically scans by GE equipment used RAS while Siemens and others used LPS.  Since several GE researchers were early contributors to Slicer, RAS was adopted for the internal representation.

Slicer still uses RAS coordinate system for storing coordinate values internally for all data types, but for compatibility with other software, it assumes that all data in files are stored in LPS coordinate system (unless the coordinate system in the file is explicitly stated to be RAS). To achieve this, whenever Slicer reads or writes a file, it may need to flip the sign of the first two coordinate axes to convert the data to RAS coordinate system.

### What if your data is not supported?

If any of the above listed file formats cannot be loaded then report the issue on the [Slicer forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/).

If you have a file of binary data and you know the data is uncompressed and you know the way it is laid out in memory, then one way to load it in Slicer is to create a .nhdr file that points to the binary file. [RawImageGuess extension](https://github.com/acetylsalicyl/SlicerRawImageGuess) can be used to explore an unknown data set, determining unknown loading parameters, and generate header file.

You can also ask about support for a particular file format on the [Slicer forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/). There may be extensions or scripts that can read or write additional formats (any Python package can be installed and used for data import/export).
