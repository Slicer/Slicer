**Usage**: Copy-paste the code lines displayed below or the linked `.py` file contents into Python console in Slicer. Or save them to a `.py` file and run them using `execfile`.

To run a Python code snippet automatically at each application startup, add it to the [.slicerrc.py file](../user_guide/settings.md#application-startup-file).

**Fully worked examples**:
* The [Slicer source code](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer) is about half written in Python and can be used to find working examples
* Most [Slicer Extensions](https://github.com/topics/3d-slicer-extension) are written in Python to address specific use cases.  Looking at their source code can be valuable.
* The [Slicer Discourse forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/) has many code snippets and discussions.
