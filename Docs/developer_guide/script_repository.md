# Script repository

:::{note}

**Usage**: Copy-paste the code lines displayed below or the linked `.py` file contents into Python console in Slicer. Or save them to a `.py` file and run them using `execfile`.

To run a Python code snippet automatically at each application startup, add it to the [.slicerrc.py file](../user_guide/settings.md#application-startup-file).

**More reference code**:
The Slicer source code has Python [scripted modules](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/tree/master/Modules/Scripted) and [scripted Segmentation Editor effects](https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer/tree/master/Modules/Loadable/Segmentations/EditorEffects/Python) that can be used as working examples.
* Most [Slicer Extensions](https://github.com/topics/3d-slicer-extension) are written in Python to address specific use cases.  Looking at their source code can be informative.
* The [Slicer Discourse forum](https://discourse.slicer.org/) has many code snippets and discussions.
