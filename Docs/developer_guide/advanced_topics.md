## Memory Management


### Pointers to VTK object

If you are not familiar with VTK's memory management read this [general introduction](https://aosabook.org/en/vtk.html) and this [page describing usage of smart pointers](https://www.vtk.org/Wiki/VTK/Tutorials/SmartPointers). See Slicer-specific use cases and recommendations below.

Calling the plain `New()` method of VTK objects and storing the returned pointer in a plain pointer should be avoided, as this very often causes memory leaks.

Bad, should be avoided:

```cpp
vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode* vol = vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode::New();
// ... do something, such as vol->GetImageData(), someObject->SetVolume(vol)...
vol->Delete();
vol=NULL;
```

Recommended:

```cpp
vtkNew<MRMLScalarVolumeNode> vol;
//... do something, such as vol->GetImageData(), someObject->SetVolume(vol.GetPointer())...
```

Also good:

```cpp
vtkSmartPointer<MRMLScalarVolumeNode> vol=vtkSmartPointer<MRMLScalarVolumeNode>::New();
///... do something, such as vol->GetImageData(), someObject->SetVolume(vol)...
```

`vtkNew` is preferred in general for new object creation, as it has a simpler syntax and used almost exclusively in the Slicer core source code. A slight inconvenience is that when we need use the `GetPointer()` method to get the actual pointer value.

A `vtkSmartPointer` pointer can be created without actually creating an object, so `vtkSmartPointer` should be used when:

* we don't know the exact object type that we want to create at the time of the pointer creation (e.g., we create a `vtkSmartPointer<vtkMRMLVolumeNode>` and later set it to point to a `vtkMRMLScalarVolumeNode` or `vtkMRMLVectorVolumeNode`), or
* we need to take the ownership of an already created object (using `vtkSmartPointer::Take(...)`; see examples below)

### Factory methods

Similarly to VTK, Slicer contains some "factory" methods:

- `vtkMRMLScene::CreateNodeByClass()`
- `vtkMRMLScene::GetNodesByClass()`
- ...

Factory methods return a pointer to a VTK object (with a reference count of 1) that the caller "owns", so the caller must take care of releasing the object to avoid memory leak.

#### Loadable modules (C++)

If storing in a new variable:

```cpp
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCollection> nodes = vtkSmartPointer<vtkCollection>::Take(mrmlScene->GetNodesByClass("vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode"));
```

If the variable is created already:

```cpp
vtkSmartPointer<vtkCollection> nodes;
nodes.TakeReference(mrmlScene->GetNodesByClass("vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode"));
```

Unsafe, legacy method without using smart pointers (not recommended, because the `Delete()` method may be forgotten or skipped due to an early return from the function):

```cpp
vtkCollection* nodes = mrmlScene->GetNodesByClass("vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode");
// ...
nodes->Delete();
```

#### Python scripts and scripted modules

Factory methods return an object that the caller owns (and thus the caller has to delete, with reference count >0) and Python adds an additional reference to this object when stored in a Python variable, resulting in a reference count of >1. To make sure that the object is deleted when the Python variable is deleted, we have to remove the additional reference that the factory method added. There is currently no automatic mechanism to remove that additional reference, so it has to be done manually by calling `UnRegister` (the reference count shouldn't be explicitly set to any specific value, it is only allowed to increment/decrement it using `Register`/`UnRegister`):

```py
nodes = slicer.mrmlScene.GetNodesByClass('vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode')
nodes.UnRegister(slicer.mrmlScene) # reference count is increased by both the factory method and the python reference; unregister to keep only the python reference
# ...
```

**To avoid forgetting the UnRegister call, it is better to avoid factory methods whenever it is possible.**

For example, instead of using the `CreateNodeByClass` factory method and call `UnRegister` manually:

```py
n = slicer.mrmlScene.CreateNodeByClass('vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode')
slicer.mrmlScene.AddNode(n)
n.UnRegister(slicer.mrmlScene)
```

this should be used:

```py
n = slicer.mrmlScene.AddNewNodeByClass('vtkMRMLLinearTransformNode')
```

Note: MRML scene's `CreateNodeByClass` creates a node with the default settings set in the scene for that node type (using [vtkMRMLScene::AddDefaultNode](https://www.slicer.org/doc/html/classvtkMRMLScene.html#ae302c5ed4aabb2910bc35dcc9aa2513f)).

## Working directory

Similarly to other software, the current directory associated with Slicer corresponds to the folder the application executable is started from.

Since the current working directory can be changed anytime by any module or Python package (e.g., to more conveniently write files in a specific directory) and it is not possible to enforce that the directory is restored to the original.

Slicer provides a way to reliably access the working directory at startup time, through the `startupWorkingPath` application property:

In Python:
```python
slicer.app.startupWorkingPath
```

In C++:
```cpp
qSlicerCoreApplication::startupWorkingPath()
```

## View layout definition

View layout definition describes what views (3D, slice, plot, table, etc.) should be displayed and where.
It is specified by an XML string.

A layout may contain multiple _viewports_, each viewport is a separate window, which may be displayed in the main application window or separately, for example on a second screen.

XML elements and their attributes:
- `viewports`: optional, if specified then it must be the root element. It can be used for specifying multiple viewports. It contains nested `layout` elements.
- `layout`: The layout elements describe widget containers that embed one or multiple items. Arrangement of items are specified by type attribute of the layout element. It may be root element or it may be nested in `viewports` or `item` element.
  - `type`: `vertical`, `horizontal`, `grid`, `tab`.
  - `split`: `true` or `false` (default), if `true` then the user can resize the views in it by dragging the splitter between the views. Default size can be set using `splitSize` attribute of child items. Only for `vertical` and `horizontal` layout type.
  - `name`: unique name of the layout, required if there are multiple viewports. If name is not specified then the empty string will be used as name. The empty string is a valid name, which refers to the default viewport, i.e., that is displayed in the application's main window.
  - `label`: optional, if specified then this will be used as
  - `dockable`: `true` (default) or `false` display the viewport as a dockable widget.
  - `dockPosition`: If dockable, this can make the widget be docked by default. Valid choices are `floating` (default), `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-right`, `top-left`, `top-right`.
- `item`: container for view(s) or layouts, nested in `layout` element.
  - `splitSize`: default size if split is enabled in the layout
- `view`: view widget, nested in `item` element.
  - `name`: this name is displayed in the view's title bar
  - `horizontalStretch` or `verticalStretch`: Relative size of views can be adjusted by specifying these stretch factors. The stretch factor must be an integer in the range of [0, 255].
  - `row` and `column`: row and column index. Only for `grid` layout type.
  - `class`: class of the view node, such as `vtkMRMLSliceNode`, `vtkMRMLViewNode`, `vtkMRMLTableViewNode`, `vtkMRMLPlotViewNode`.
  - `singletontag`: layout name of the view node (`1`, `2`, ... for 3D views; `Red`, `Yellow`, ... for slice views)
- `property`: contains view properties
  - `name`: property name, such as `viewlabel` (displayed in the view's title bar), `orientation` (for slice views),
  - element text: property value

### Example: Simple 4-up view layout

```xml
<layout type="vertical" split="true">
  <item>
  <view class="vtkMRMLViewNode" singletontag="1">
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">1</property>
  </view>
  </item>
  <item>
  <view class="vtkMRMLSliceNode" singletontag="Red">
    <property name="orientation" action="default">Axial</property>
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">R</property>
    <property name="viewcolor" action="default">#F34A33</property>
  </view>
  </item>
</layout>
```

### Example: Layout containing two viewports

```xml
<viewports>
 <!--default viewport-->
 <layout type="horizontal">
  <item>
   <view class="vtkMRMLSliceNode" singletontag="Red">
    <property name="orientation" action="default">Axial</property>
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">R</property>
    <property name="viewcolor" action="default">#F34A33</property>
   </view>
  </item>
  <item>
   <view class="vtkMRMLViewNode" singletontag="1">
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">1</property>
   </view>
  </item>
 </layout>
 <!--second dockable viewport-->
 <layout type="horizontal"  label="Views+" dockable="true" dockPosition="bottom">>
  <item>
   <view class="vtkMRMLSliceNode" singletontag="Red+">
    <property name="orientation" action="default">Axial</property>
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">R+</property>
    <property name="viewcolor" action="default">#f9a99f</property>
    <property name="viewgroup" action="default">1</property>
   </view>
  </item>
  <item>
   <view class="vtkMRMLViewNode" singletontag="1+" type="secondary">
    <property name="viewlabel" action="default">1+</property>
    <property name="viewgroup" action="default">1</property>
   </view>
  </item>
 </layout>
</viewports>
```
