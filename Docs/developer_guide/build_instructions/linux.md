# GNU/Linux systems

The instructions to build Slicer for GNU/Linux systems are slightly different
depending on the linux distribution and the specific configuration of the
system. In the following sections you can find instructions that will work for
some of the most common linux distributions in their standard configuration. If
you are using a different distribution you can use [these instructions](./linux.md#any-distribution)
to adapt the process to your system. You can also ask questions
related to the building process in the [Slicer forum](https://discourse.slicer.org).

## Pre-requisites

First, you need to install the tools that will be used for fetching the source
code of slicer, generating the project files and build the project.

- Git and Subversion for fetching the code and version control.
- GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for code compilation.
- CMake for configuration/generation of the project.
  - (Optional) CMake curses gui to configure the project from the command line.
  - (Optional) CMake Qt gui to configure the project through a GUI.
- GNU Make
- GNU Patch

In addition, Slicer requires a set of support libraries that are not includes as
part of the *superbuild*:

- Qt5 with the components listed below. Qt version 5.15.2 is recommended, other Qt versions are not tested and may cause build errors or may cause problems when running the application.
  - Multimedia
  - UiTools
  - XMLPatterns
  - SVG
  - WebEngine
  - Script
  - X11Extras
  - Private
- libXt

### Debian 11 Stable (Bullseye) and Testing (Bookworm) 

Install the development tools and the support libraries:

```console
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git subversion build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui cmake-qt-gui \
  qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtwebengine5-dev qtscript5-dev \
  qtbase5-private-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libxt-dev libssl-dev
```

### Ubuntu 21.10 (Impish Indri)

Install the development tools and the support libraries:

```console
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git subversion build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui cmake-qt-gui \
  qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtwebengine5-dev qtscript5-dev \
  qtbase5-private-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libxt-dev libssl-dev
```

### Ubuntu 20.04 (Focal Fossa)

:::{warning}
Since the default Qt5 packages available on Ubuntu 20.04 correspond to version 5.12.8 and version 5.15.2 is used to build and test the packages available for download. Compiling Slicer against version 5.12.8 may not succeed, and if it does, the compiled Slicer application may behave differently.

To use Qt 5.15.2, we recommend you download and install following [these instructions](./linux.md#any-distribution)
:::

Install the development tools and the support libraries:

```console
sudo apt update && sudo apt install git subversion build-essential cmake cmake-curses-gui cmake-qt-gui \
  qt5-default qtmultimedia5-dev qttools5-dev libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev libqt5svg5-dev qtwebengine5-dev qtscript5-dev \
  qtbase5-private-dev libqt5x11extras5-dev libxt-dev
```

### ArchLinux

:::{cautious}
ArchLinux uses a rolling-release package distribution approach. This means that the versions of the packages will change over time and the following instructions might not be actual. **Last time tested: 2022-03-08.**
:::

Install the development tools and the support libraries:

```console
sudo pacman -S git make patch subversion gcc cmake \
  qt5-base qt5-multimedia qt5-tools qt5-xmlpatterns qt5-svg qt5-webengine qt5-script qt5-x11extras libxt
```

### CentOS 7
:::{note}
Slicer built on CentOS 7 will be available for many Linux distributions and releases
:::

Install Qt and CMake as described in [Any Distribution](./linux.md#any-distribution) section.

Since by default CentOS 7 comes with `gcc 4.8.5` only having [experimental support for C++14](https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc-4.8.5/gcc/C-Dialect-Options.html#C-Dialect-Options), the following allows to install and activate the `devtoolset-11` [providing](https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_developer_toolset/11/html/11.0_release_notes/dts11.0_release#Changes_in_DTS) `gcc 11.2.1` [supporting C++20](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/20):

```console
sudo yum install centos-release-scl
sudo yum install devtoolset-11-gcc*
scl enable devtoolset-11 bash         # activation is needed for every terminal session
```

Install pre-requisites:
```console
sudo yum install patch mesa-libGL-devel libuuid-devel
```

### Any Distribution

This section describes how to install Qt as distributed by *The QT Company*, which can be used for any GNU/Linux distribution.

:::{important}
This process requires an account in [qt.io](https://qt.io) 

:::

Download the Qt linux online installer and make it executable:

```console
 curl -LO http://download.qt.io/official_releases/online_installers/qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
 chmod +x qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run
```
You can run the installer and follow the instructions in the GUI. Keep in mind that the components needed by 3D Slicer are: `qt.qt5.5152.gcc_64`, `qt.qt5.5152.qtscript` `qt.qt5.5152.qtscript.gcc_64`, `qt.qt5.5152.qtwebengine` and `qt.qt5.5152.qtwebengine.gcc_64`.

Alternatively, you can request the installation of the components with the following command (you will be prompted for license agreements and permissions):

```console
export QT_ACCOUNT_LOGIN=<set your qt.io account email here>
export QT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD=<set your password here>
./qt-unified-linux-x64-online.run \
  install \
    qt.qt5.5152.gcc_64 \
    qt.qt5.5152.qtscript \
    qt.qt5.5152.qtscript.gcc_64 \
    qt.qt5.5152.qtwebengine \
    qt.qt5.5152.qtwebengine.gcc_64 \
  --root /opt/qt \
  --email $QT_ACCOUNT_LOGIN \
  --pw $QT_ACCOUNT_PASSWORD
```
:::{hint}
When configuring the Slicer build project, the CMake variable `Qt5_DIR` need to be set using the full path to the Qt5 installation directory ending with `5.15.2/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5`. For example, assuming you installed Qt in `/opt/qt`, you may use `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release -DQt5_DIR:PATH=/opt/qt/5.15.2/gcc_64/lib/cmake/Qt5 ../Slicer`.

:::

## Checkout Slicer source files

The recommended way to obtain the source code of SLicer is cloning the repository using `git`:

```console
git clone https://github.com/Slicer/Slicer.git
```

This will create a `Slicer` directory containing the source code of Slicer.
Hereafter we will call this directory the `source directory`.

:::{tip}
It is highly recommended to **avoid** the use of the **space** character in the name of the `source directory` or any of its parent directories.

:::

After obtaining the source code, we need to set up the development environment:

```console
cd Slicer
./Utilities/SetupForDevelopment.sh
cd ..
```

% TODO: Link to the readthedocs equivalent of https://www.slicer.org/wiki/Documentation/Nightly/Developers/DevelopmentWithGit

## Configure and generate the Slicer build project files

Slicer is highly configurable and multi-platform. To support this,
Slicer needs a configuration of the build parameters before the build process
takes place. In this configuration stage, it is possible to adjust variables
that change the nature and behavior of its components. For instance, the type
of build (Debug or Release mode), whether to use system-installed libraries,
let the build process fetch and compile own libraries, or enable/disable some of
the software components and functionalities of Slicer.

The following folders will be used in the instructions below:

| Folder          | Path   |
|-----------------|--------|
| **source**      | `~/Slicer` |
| **build**       |  `~/Slicer-SuperBuild-Debug` |
| **inner-build** |  `~/Slicer-SuperBuild-Debug/Slicer-build` |

To obtain a default configuration of the Slicer build project, create the **build** folder and use `cmake`:

```console
mkdir Slicer-SuperBuild-Debug
cd Slicer-SuperBuild-Debug
cmake ../Slicer
```

It is possible to change variables with `cmake`. In the following example we
change the built type (Debug as default) to Release:

```console
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release ../Slicer
```

:::{admonition} Tip -- Interfaces to change 3D Slicer configuration variables

Instead of `cmake`, one can use `ccmake`, which provides a text-based interface or `cmake-gui`, which provides a graphical user interface. These applications will also provide a list of variables that can be changed.

:::

:::{admonition} Tip -- Speed up 3D Slicer build with `ccache`

`ccache` is a compiler cache that can speed up subsequent build of 3D Slicer. This can be useful if 3D Slicer is built often and there are no large divergences between subsequent builds. This requires `ccache` installed on the system (e.g., `sudo apt install ccache`).

The first time `ccache` is used, the compilation time can marginally increased as it includes the first caching. After the first build, subsequent build times will decrease significantly.

`ccache` is not detected as a valid compiler by the 3D Slicer building process. You can generate local symbolic links to disguise the use of `ccache` as valid compilers:

```console
ln -s /usr/bin/ccache ~/.local/bin/c++
ln -s /usr/bin/ccache ~/.local/bin/cc
```

Then, the Slicer build can be configured to use these compilers:

```console
cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release \
  -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER:STRING=$HOME/.local/bin/c++ \
  -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER:STRING=$HOME/.local/bin/cc \
  ../Slicer
```

:::

## Build Slicer

Once the Slicer build project files have been generated, the Slicer project can
be built by running this command in the **build** folder

```console
make
```

:::{admonition} Tip -- Parallel build 

Building Slicer will generally take long time, particularly on the first build or upon code/configuration changes. To help speeding up the process one can use `make -j<N>`, where `<N>` is the number of parallel builds. As a rule of thumb, many uses the `number of CPU threads + 1` as the number of parallel builds.

:::

:::{warning}

Increasing the number of parallel builds generally increases the memory required for the build process. In the event that the required memory exceeds the available memory, the process will either fail or start using swap memory, which will make in practice the system to freeze.

:::

:::{admonition} Tip -- Error detection during parallel build

Using parallel builds makes finding compilation errors difficult due to the fact that all parallel build processes use the same screen output, as opposed to sequential builds, where the compilation process will stop at the error. A common technique to have parallel builds and easily find errors is launch a parallel build followed by a sequential build. For the parallel build, it is advised to run `make -j<N> -k` to have the parallel build keep going as far as possible before doing the sequential build with `make`.

:::

## Run Slicer

After the building process has successfully completed, the executable file to
run Slicer will be located in the **inner-build** folder.

The application can be launched by these commands:

```console
cd Slicer-build
./Slicer`
```

## Test Slicer

After building, run the tests in the **inner-build** folder.

Type the following (you can replace 4 by the number of processor cores in the computer):

```console
ctest -j4
```

## Package Slicer

Start a terminal and type the following in the **inner-build** folder:

```console
make package
```
