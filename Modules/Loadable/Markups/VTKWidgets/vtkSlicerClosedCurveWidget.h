/**
 * @class   vtkSlicerClosedCurveWidget
 * @brief   create a curve with a set of N points
 *
 * The vtkSlicerClosedCurveWidget is used to create a closed
 * curve widget with a set of N points.
 * The widget handles all processing of widget
 * events (that are triggered by VTK events). The vtkSlicerCurveRepresentation is
 * responsible for all placement of the points, and
 * curve manipulation. This is done through a main helper class:
 * vtkPointPlacer. The representation is also
 * responsible for drawing the points.
 *
 * @par Event Bindings:
 * By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
 * watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
 * <pre>
 *   LeftButtonPressEvent - triggers a Select event
 *   Alt + LeftButtonPressEvent - triggers a Rotate event
 *   MiddleButtonPressEvent - triggers a Translate event
 *   RightButtonPressEvent - triggers a Pick event
 *   Alt + RightButtonPressEvent - triggers a Scale event
 *
 *   MouseMoveEvent - triggers a Move event
 *
 *   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - triggers an EndAction event
 *   MiddleButtonReleaseEvent - triggers an EndAction event
 *   RightButtonReleaseEvent - triggers an EndAction event
 *
 *   LeftButtonDoubleClickEvent - triggers an Pick event
 *   MiddleButtonDoubleClickEvent - triggers an Pick event
 *   RightButtonDoubleClickEvent - triggers an Pick event
 *
 *   Delete key event - triggers a Delete event
 *   Shift + Delete key event - triggers a Reset event
 * </pre>
 *
