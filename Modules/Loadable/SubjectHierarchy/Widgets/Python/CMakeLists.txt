# Note: The SubjectHierarchyPlugins subdirectory is needed to have a Python package
# (https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html#packages) in the source tree
# the same way as it is in the install tree. The Python package name is used
# for determining the "context" string (packageName.filename) for language translation (i18n).
