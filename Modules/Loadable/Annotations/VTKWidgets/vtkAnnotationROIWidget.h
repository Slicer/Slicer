///  vtkAnnotationROIWidget - 3D widget for manipulating a box
///
/// This 3D widget interacts with a vtkAnnotationROIRepresentation class (i.e., it
/// handles the events that drive its corresponding representation). The
/// representation is assumed to represent a region of interest that is
/// represented by an arbitrarily oriented hexahedron (or box) with interior
/// face angles of 90 degrees (i.e., orthogonal faces). The representation
/// manifests seven handles that can be moused on and manipulated, plus the
/// six faces can also be interacted with. The first six handles are placed on
/// the six faces, the seventh is in the center of the box. In addition, a
/// bounding box outline is shown, the "faces" of which can be selected for
/// object rotation or scaling. A nice feature of vtkAnnotationROIWidget, like any 3D
/// widget, will work with the current interactor style. That is, if
/// vtkAnnotationROIWidget does not handle an event, then all other registered
/// observers (including the interactor style) have an opportunity to process
/// the event. Otherwise, the vtkAnnotationROIWidget will terminate the processing of
/// the event that it handles.
//
/// To use this widget, you generally pair it with a vtkAnnotationROIRepresentation
/// (or a subclass). Various options are available in the representation for
/// controlling how the widget appears, and how the widget functions.
//
/// .SECTION Event Bindings
/// By default, the widget responds to the following VTK events (i.e., it
/// watches the vtkRenderWindowInteractor for these events):
/// <pre>
/// If one of the seven handles are selected:
///   LeftButtonPressEvent - select the appropriate handle
///   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the currently selected handle
///   MouseMoveEvent - move the handle
/// If one of the faces is selected:
///   LeftButtonPressEvent - select a box face
///   LeftButtonReleaseEvent - release the box face
///   MouseMoveEvent - rotate the box
/// In all the cases, independent of what is picked, the widget responds to the
/// following VTK events:
///   MiddleButtonPressEvent - translate the widget
///   MiddleButtonReleaseEvent - release the widget
///   RightButtonPressEvent - scale the widget's representation
///   RightButtonReleaseEvent - stop scaling the widget
///   MouseMoveEvent - scale (if right button) or move (if middle button) the widget
/// </pre>
//
/// Note that the event bindings described above can be changed using this
/// class's vtkWidgetEventTranslator. This class translates VTK events
/// into the vtkAnnotationROIWidget's widget events:
/// <pre>
///   vtkWidgetEvent::Select -- some part of the widget has been selected
///   vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect -- the selection process has completed
///   vtkWidgetEvent::Scale -- some part of the widget has been selected
///   vtkWidgetEvent::EndScale -- the selection process has completed
///   vtkWidgetEvent::Translate -- some part of the widget has been selected
///   vtkWidgetEvent::EndTranslate -- the selection process has completed
///   vtkWidgetEvent::Move -- a request for motion has been invoked
/// </pre>
//
/// In turn, when these widget events are processed, the vtkAnnotationROIWidget
/// invokes the following VTK events on itself (which observers can listen for):
/// <pre>
///   vtkCommand::StartInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Select)
///   vtkCommand::EndInteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::EndSelect)
///   vtkCommand::InteractionEvent (on vtkWidgetEvent::Move)
/// </pre>

/// .SECTION Caveats
/// Note that in some cases the widget can be picked even when it is "behind"
/// other actors.  This is an intended feature and not a bug.
///
/// This class, and the affiliated vtkAnnotationROIRepresentation, are second generation
/// VTK widgets. An earlier version of this functionality was defined in the
/// class vtkAnnotationROIWidget.
