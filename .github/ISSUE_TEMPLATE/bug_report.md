## Summary

<!-- Give a short summary of what the problem is. Note: Before submitting an error report, please test if the problem is reproducible in the latest Slicer Preview Release. If the problem does not occur in the latest Slicer Preview Release then most likely it has been already fixed and there is no need to report it again. If you are not sure if Slicer works incorrectly or you are not using it as intended then clarify it by asking on the Slicer Forum - https://discourse.slicer.org -->

## Steps to reproduce

<!--
    Generally, Slicer developers can only fix those issues that they can reproduce on their computers.

    To achieve this, please:
    * Describe in this section what you did, what you expected to happen, and what happened instead.
    * Attach a few screenshots if possible.
    * Use one of the Slicer sample data sets (in Sample Data module) as inputs. If you cannot reproduce the problem with sample data sets then you can upload your data somewhere and provide a download link here (make sure to remove all patient information from the data before sharing).

    If the problem cannot be reproduced by using the graphical user interface but only by running custom Python or C++ code then please create a short self-contained example as described at http://sscce.org

    To describe "Actual behavior" and "Expected behavior" you may use the following format:
    1. Do A
    2. Do B => Slicer does Y - OK
    3. Do C => Slicer does Z => ERROR: Slicer should do W instead
    4. Do D => Slicer does Z - OK
    5. Do B => Slicer does Y => ERROR: Slicer should do X instead
-->

## Environment
- Slicer version: Slicer-5.??.?-YYYY-MM-DD
- Operating system: Windows / Linux / Mac + which version
