## Summary

<!-- Give a short summary of what the problem is. Note: Before submitting an error report, please test if the problem is reproducible in the latest Slicer Preview Release. If the problem does not occur in the latest Slicer Preview Release then most likely it has been already fixed and there is no need to report it again. If you are not sure if Slicer works incorrectly or you are not using it as intended then clarify it by asking on the Slicer Forum - https://discourse.slicer.org -->

## Steps to reproduce

<!-- Generally, Slicer developers can only fix those issues that they can reproduce on their computers. To achieve this, please describe in this section what you did and what happened. Attach a few screenshots if possible. Use one of the Slicer sample data sets (in Sample Data module) as inputs. If you cannot reproduce the problem with sample data sets then you can upload your data somewhere and provide a download link here (make sure to remove all patient information from the data before sharing). If the problem occurs by using the application from custom code, create a short self-contained example as described at http://sscce.org -->

## Expected behavior

<!-- Describe what you expected to happen. -->

## Environment
- Slicer version: Slicer-5.??.?-YYYY-MM-DD
