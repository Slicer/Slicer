    authors:
      # Excludes automated dependency updates for GitHub workflows, as these are not Slicer dependencies and are not relevant for the changelog.
      - dependabot

      # Manages Slicer.crt certificate updates (see update-slicer-certificate-bundle.yml).
      # PRs from slicerbot are intentionally *not* excluded, as they update the Slicer.crt certificate, and documenting these changes is useful.
      # - slicerbot

      # Excludes automated pre-commit updates (see pre-commit-autoupdate.yml) used for linting.
      # These updates involve only formatting changes, which would add unnecessary noise to the changelog.
