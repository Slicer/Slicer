/// \brief Algorithm class for computing topological hierarchy of multiple poly data models.
///   The levels of the models are determined according to the models they contain, an outer
///   model always having larger level value than the inner ones. To determine whether a model
///   contains another, their bounding boxes are considered. It is possible to constrain a gap
///   or allow the inner model to protrude the surface of the outer one. The size of this gap
///   or allowance is defined as a factor /sa ContainConstraintFactor of the outer model size.
///   This algorithm can be used to automatically determine optimal opacities in complex scenes.
