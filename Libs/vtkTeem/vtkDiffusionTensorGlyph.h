/// \brief scale and orient glyph(s) according to tensor eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
///
/// vtkDiffusionTensorGlyph is a filter that copies a geometric representation (specified
/// as polygonal data) to every input point. The geometric representation, or
/// glyph, can be scaled and/or rotated according to the tensor at the input
/// point. Scaling and rotation is controlled by the eigenvalues/eigenvectors
/// of the tensor as follows. For each tensor, the eigenvalues (and associated
/// eigenvectors) are sorted to determine the major, medium, and minor
/// eigenvalues/eigenvectors. The major eigenvalue scales the glyph in the
/// x-direction, the medium in the y-direction, and the minor in the
/// z-direction. Then, the glyph is rotated so that the glyph's local x-axis
/// lies along the major eigenvector, y-axis along the medium eigenvector, and
/// z-axis along the minor.
///
/// A scale factor is provided to control the amount of scaling. Also, you
/// can turn off scaling completely if desired. The boolean variable
/// ClampScaling controls the maximum scaling (in conjunction with
/// MaxScaleFactor.) This is useful in certain applications where
/// singularities or large order of magnitude differences exist in
/// the eigenvalues.
///
/// Another instance variable, ExtractEigenvalues, has been provided to
/// control extraction of eigenvalues/eigenvectors. If this boolean is false,
/// then eigenvalues/eigenvectors are not extracted, and the columns of the
/// tensor are taken as the eigenvectors (norm of column is eigenvalue).
/// This allows additional capability over the vtkGlyph3D object. That is, the
/// glyph can be oriented in three directions instead of one.
///
/// To accommodate display in another coordinate system besides the ijk
/// coordinate system of the volume array, two matrices are provided.
/// The VolumePosition matrix positions each tensor in the correct location
/// to account for voxel translation and rotation of the volume.
/// (Scaling is already handled well in vtk ImageData.)
/// The TensorRotationMatrix rotates each tensor into the new
/// coordinate system.
///
/// Types of scalars that may be generated from tensors for coloring are defined
/// in vtkDiffusionTensorMathematics.h.  If the ColorMode is set to Eigenvalues, then
/// glyphs are colored according to a function of the eigenvalues.  These
/// functions are scalar invariants of the diffusion tensor.  They are selected
/// by calling ColorGlyphsByFractionalAnisotropy, etc.
